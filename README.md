# chunks-2-symfony-conf-webpack-plugin
Plugin for webpack 4, that outputs build files to JSON

## Instalation 

```
npm i --save-dev chunks-2-json-webpack-plugin
```

## Use case

Webpack is a great tool and has without a doubt revolutionized the way we build frontend applications. However usually, due to the (great) caching strategy, chunk files will have hash appended to their file name. And if you want to use your build in an env, that does not know 
anything about this, it becomes complicated to inject the build in your app.

Therefore this plugin was build, as it will output your chunks in a JSON file, that will 
allow other apps to understand the structure of the build. 


## Usage example

#### Input

```javascript

const Chunks2JsonPlugin = require('chunks-2-json-webpack-plugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  plugins: [
    new Chunks2JsonPlugin({ outputDir: 'dist/', filename: 'my-app.json' })
  ]
};

```

#### Output

```JSON
{
  "chunk-vendors": {
    "js": "/js/chunk-vendors.fc40696c.js",
    "jsMap": "/js/chunk-vendors.fc40696c.js.map"
  },
  "app": {
    "css": "/css/app.eb829ccc.css",
    "js": "/js/app.dd31cdcb.js",
    "jsMap": "/js/app.dd31cdcb.js.map"
  }
}
```

## Options

There are 2 input options available 

| Option | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| outputDir | Folder in which to output the JSON file. If the folder does not exist, we'll try to create it |
| filename | Name of the outputed JSON file |
